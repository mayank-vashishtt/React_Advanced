learn react after only mastering js 

facebook have ghost message problem(phantom problem) -- no consistency in UI 

react sync the JS and DOM , state and UI 

react is library 

framework == military  --> rules are strict 
library == cool dude 

UI manipulation, JSX
component resusability 
props 
hooks

react dont have build in router -- download react-router-dom 
state management, redux react, redux toolkit, zustand, context API 
class based component  -- legacy code 
BAAS Apps -- social media clone, <backend as a service>
appwrite is a baas


after react (no SEO, browser render of JS, no routing)

NOTES  



vite application / parcel are bundlers --  npm create vite@latest -- quite fast --- brought on file but didnt install , do npm i  -- npm run dev(dev is script name in package.json)


CRA(create-react-app) vs vite

npx create-react-app -- it is little bit bulky  -- npx create-react-app basicrect  --- OG , installed it  -- npm run start 


react -- react-dom(talk to my dom in my browser), react-native(talk to mobile), 3D application to here


build command are used to deploy these on vercel or netify 

react app is called spa -- single page applcation 

in jsx you can return only one element, use parent and child relation or <> </> use this 

in vite, you should use jsx for return like thing and function name should be in capital even having filename in capital is good practice 

in vite, there is manual script and in cra there is custom script

if you give hello {usename} --- will take username from inside that function 

use state -- first one is variable .. second one is method 

batching -- to avoid it use callbacks 

react fiber architecture  -- read docs

reconcilliation -- read docs

we have to install all npm and all lib that we need in root dir where package.json is
